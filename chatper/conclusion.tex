\section{Conclusion}
This \replaced[id=kg]{study}{paper} presents NetV.js, an open source, WebGL-based JavaScript library for large-scale node-link diagrams. In the future, we plan to extend \name to support heterogeneous graphs. We also \replaced[id=kg]{intend}{plan} to implement more visualization components and visual analysis algorithms for analyzing graph data.
