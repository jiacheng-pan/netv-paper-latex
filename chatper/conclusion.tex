\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents NetV.js, an open source, WebGL-based Javascript library for large-scale node-link diagrams. In the future, we plan to extend \name to support heterogeneous graphs. We also plan to implement more visualization components and visual analysis algorithms for analyzing graph data.
