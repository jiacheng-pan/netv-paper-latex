\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents NetV.js, an open-sourced, JavaScript-based, WebGL-based library that supports the rapid large-scale network rendering, interaction, and visualization. In the future, we plan to extend \name to support heterogeneous networks. We also plan to explore more visualization components and visual analysis algorithms for analyzing network data.
